This is a quick summery of pyTorch tutorial video.
#You can see the video at 'https://youtu.be/u7x8RXwLKcA'.

pyTorch is one of the most populer open source deep learning frameworks. 
It has features as 'fast', 'flexible experimentation' and 'seamless'. 
Seamless means the seamless transition to production deployment.

pyTorch is built to use the power of GPU for faster training and us python for easy starting.
We can start pyTorch by '60 minute blitz' authored by Soumith Chintala.
The goals of this tutorial are
1. 'Understanding PyTorch's Tensor library and neural networks at a high level'
2. 'Train a small neural network to classify images'

For this course, we should have a basic understanding of 'numPy'.

This course has five modules;
1. What is PyTorch
2. Autograd: Automatic Differentiation
3. Neural Networks
4. Training a Classifier
5. (Optional) Data Parallelism

So, let's get start.
